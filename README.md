New to coding and looking for friends/mentors/teachers

Hey, my name is Ryan. I'm completley new to coding and don't really know anything yet. I've spent the last few weeks half heartedly trying to teach my self Python. I don't think i've done too bad so far and I haven't had any problem with understanding the conecepts but I'm at a point now though where I want to throw myself at it 100%!

If anyone can pass on any nuggets of wisdom/advice, give me challenges or things to learn/research that would be amazing!

I'm looking to enroll on a Software Engineering degree is September 2019 so I would like to give myself the best foundation I can prior to that.

Thanks =)
